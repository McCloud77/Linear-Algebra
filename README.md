# Linear-Algebra
Jupyter notebooks related to linear algebra in general
Inspired by the course 'Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers' from The University of Texas at Austin on edX.org.
The main thread in the notebooks is the concept of 'slicing and dicing' vectors and matrices when performing, e.g., a matrix-matrix multiplication.
